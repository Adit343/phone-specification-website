            Apple Inc. is a technology company based in Cupertino, California,
            that designs, develops, and sells consumer electronics, software,
            and online services. The company is most well-known for its
            iPhone, a line of smartphones that revolutionized the mobile phone
            industry when it was first introduced in 2007. The iPhone quickly
            became one of Apple's flagship products, and the company has
            continued to release updated models with new features and
            improvements each year. Apple was founded in 1976 by Steve Jobs,
            Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne, and originally focused on
            producing personal computers. Over time, the company has expanded
            into a variety of other product lines, including tablets,
            smartwatches, and home automation devices. Today, Apple is one of
            the largest and most profitable companies in the world, with a
            market capitalization of over $2 trillion.
